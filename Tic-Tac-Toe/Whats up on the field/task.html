<h2>What's up on the field?</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In this stage, we’re going to analyze the game state to determine if either of the players has already won the game
    or it is still ongoing, if the game is a draw, or if the user has entered an impossible game state (two winners, or
    with one player having made too many moves).
</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Take a string entered by the user and print the game grid as in the previous stage.</li>
    <li>Analyze the game state and print the result. Possible states:
        <ul>
            <li>"Game not finished" when no side has a three in a row but there are still empty cells</li>
            <li>"Draw" when no side has a three in a row and there are no empty cells</li>
            <li>"X wins" when the field has three X in a row</li>
            <li>"O wins" when the field has three O in a row</li>
            <li>"Impossible" when the grid has three X’s in a row as well as three O’s in a row, or there are a lot more
                X's than O's or vice versa (the difference should be 1 or 0; if the difference is 2 or more, then the
                game state is impossible).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>In this stage, we will assume that either <code>X</code> or <code>O</code> can start the game.</p>
