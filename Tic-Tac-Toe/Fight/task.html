<h2>Fight!</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Our game is almost ready! Now let's combine what weâ€™ve learned in the previous stages to make a game of tic-tac-toe
    that two players can play from the beginning (with an empty grid) through to the end (until there is a draw, or one
    of the players wins).
</p>
<p>The first player has to play as <code>X</code> and their opponent plays as <code>O</code>.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>In this stage, you should write a program that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.</li>
    <li>Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for
        correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.
    </li>
    <li>Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.</li>
    <li>You need to output the final result at the end of the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The example below shows how your program should work.</p>
<pre><code>---------
| _ _ _ |
| _ _ _ |
| _ _ _ |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
---------
| _ _ _ |
| _ X _ |
| _ _ _ |

Enter the coordinates: 2 2
This cell is occupied! Choose another one!
Enter the coordinates: two two
You should enter numbers!
Enter the coordinates: 1 4
Coordinates should be from 1 to 3!
